Bye bye Notes!

PS: I used the following parameters with imapsync:

imapsync --host1 domino.mydomain.com --user1 "Ford Prefect" --passfile1 passfile1 --ssl1 --authmech1 PLAIN --host2 localhost --user2 ford.prefect@mydomain.com --passfile2 passfile2 --ssl2 --authmech2 PLAIN --skipsize  --nofoldersizes  --regextrans2 "s/\\\\/\\./g"  --useheader Subject --useheader Date  --allowsizemismatch --skipsize  --regextrans2 "s/\\//_/g" --include "^Folder Prefix"

--useheader Date --useheader Subject : was necessary since Notes seemed to change the message IDs, which caused duplicate messages each time imapsync was run. These two arguments limited the equality of messages to Subject and Date, which was OK for me.

--nofoldersizes : stopped imapsync from calculating the size of the folder before it runs. This caused a huge speedup since this seems to be a major task for notes to provide this operation.

--skipsize --allowsizemismatch : also was required to prevent imapsync from canceling messages that had another amount of payload data than the header suggested. Notes sometimes reported wrong message sizes which could be the same issue as the protocol error above.

--regextrans2 "s/\\\\/\\./g" : was necessary since imapsync sometimes did not apply the IMAP namespace and prefix correctly when using regular expressions for the folder names.

--regextrans2 "s/\\//_/g" : was necessary since Lotus Notes allows “/” in the folder name, which Courier IMAP does not. So all “/” where converted to “_” for the moment.

--include "^Folder Prefix" : was quite useful to limit the imapsync run to a specific folder name if you need to close in on some issues or want more control on the current migration. Leaving out this parameter simply converts all folders.

PPS: Running “imapsync” seemed to be extremely slow before enabling specific IMAP features in the Notes mail files. I had to run “convert” for each file file in order to enable IMAP folder references and generate IMAP specific attributes. This could be due to the fact that we never used IMAP in Notes and therefore had IMAP features not enabled. Which prevents Notes from creating these information during normal runtime. This information is the generated “on demand” but not stored.

Enable IMAP for mailfile: load convert -e mail/mailfile.nsf
Enable IMAP folder references: load convert -m mail/mailfile.nsf
Generate IMAP attributes: load convert -h mail/mailfile.nsf
